# Docker of DocKing

DocKing ships Docker Images too, in case you want boot it up as fast as you can for development, even production usage.

## Note

We don't add the "DB" into `docker-compose.yml`. You can choose or add it based on your need.

IRL, we always use the GCP SQL or AWS RDS (a lot of features) instead of Docker, won't we?
